  <p>
    When an agency is adding or revising only
    certain units of a section, the amendatory language must
    state exactly which units are added or revised, and only
    those units are printed. Asterisks are used to represent
    text which is not changed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>5 stars</strong> are used to show that a whole paragraph,
    including its subordinate paragraphs, is unchanged.
