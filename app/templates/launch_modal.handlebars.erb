        We've been hard at work to make
        the content on the site easier to read and navigate and to make it easier to
        understand the type of content you are currently viewing.

      <p>
        You can explore the changes using the tabs below. And you can read more
        in our blog post <%= link_to 'here', '#' %>.

            Substantive content on FederalRegister.gov is now wrapped in content
            boxes that describe the type of content and it's source. The title
            portion of these boxes can be hovered over or clicked to view these
            additional content descriptions.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

          <%= fr_content_box(
            FrBox.build(:published_document)
          ) do %>
            <em>Published Document content is displayed here...</em>
          <% end %>

          <%= fr_content_box(
            FrBox.build(:public_inspection_document)
          ) do %>
            <em>Unpublished Public Inspection Document content is displayed here...</em>
          <% end %>

          <%= fr_content_box(
            FrBox.build(:reader_aid)
          ) do %>
            <em>Educational and other helpful Reader Aid content is displayed here...</em>
          <% end %>

          <%= fr_content_box(
            FrBox.build(:enhanced_content)
          ) do %>
            <em>Enhanced content not present in the published document is displayed here...</em>
          <% end %>

          <p>
            We've changed the way we display documents to make them easier to read
            and to make document tools easier to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documents are now displayed in a single column and working with the
            Government Publishing Office we've improved the display of tables and
            images within the documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've also added an helpful utility bar that contains document tools
            and access to social media and other formats. You can find this on
            the right hand side of published documents.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

          <%= image_tag asset_path('doc_preview.png') %>
        </div>
        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="developers">
          <p>
            With the exception of MyFR everything on FederalRegister.gov
            now uses our API as its data source. This is part of our ongoing
            commitment to maintain and expand our API.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of this we've added many more endpoints to our API which not
            only power FederalRegister.gov but also make it possible for external
            developers to do more. Take a look at our
            <%= link_to "interactive documentation", "/developers/api/v1/" %>
            to see these new endpoints.
